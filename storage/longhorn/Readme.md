# Longhorn Storage Provisioner

Longhorn is a lightweight, reliable, and powerful distributed block storage system for Kubernetes.

Longhorn implements distributed block storage using containers and microservices. Longhorn creates a dedicated storage controller for each block device volume and synchronously replicates the volume across multiple replicas stored on multiple nodes. The storage controller and replicas are themselves orchestrated using Kubernetes.

See [Documentation](https://longhorn.io/docs/) for more information

## Installation

Simply Run

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longhorn/longhorn/v1.5.3/deploy/longhorn.yaml
```

To Ensure that Everything is working

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace longhorn-system
```

It should show something like this
```

If not, you need to wait until all the pods are running.

## Troubleshooting


if `longhorn-manager` is crashing due to

```
ERRO[0000] Failed environment check, please make sure you have iscsiadm/open-iscsi installed on the host
FATA[0000] Error starting manager: Environment check failed: Failed to execute: nsenter [--mount=/host/proc/1/ns/mnt --net=/host/proc/1/ns/net iscsiadm --version], output nsenter: failed to execute iscsiadm: No such file or directory
, error exit status 1
```

You might need to install open-iscsi. To install simply run

```bash
# For Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install open-iscsi -y

# For RHEL / CentOS / Fedora:
sudo yum install iscsi-initiator-utils -y
# Or on newer systems using dnf
# sudo dnf install iscsi-initiator-utils -y

# For SUSE / SLES:
sudo zypper install open-iscsi

## Enable and Start the Service
# After installing the package, it's a good practice to ensure the iSCSI service is enabled and running.

sudo systemctl enable iscsid
sudo systemctl start iscsid
```

Once you have installed the package on all your nodes, you can either wait for Kubernetes to restart the failed Longhorn pods or you can force it to happen immediately.

To force a restart, delete the failing longhorn-manager pods. Kubernetes will automatically recreate them, and this time the environment check should pass. âœ…

```bash
kubectl -n longhorn-system delete pod <name-of-failing-longhorn-manager-pod>
```


You can confirm that it has been installed using
```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

and you should see a storage class called longhorn

## Make Longhorn the Default Storage Class

First you need to mark the other storage classes if any as non-default. replace `$storageclass` with the name of the storage class (e.g. nfs-provisioner) and then apply the following

NOTE: you must use bash because of the quotes. otherwise, you have to put a backslash (\\) in front of every quote (")

```bash
kubectl patch storageclass $storageclass -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
```

and then you mark longhorn as the default storage class
```bash
kubectl patch storageclass longhorn -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```
