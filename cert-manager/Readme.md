# Setup Cert Manager

Cert Manager allows you to manage SSL Certificates. It automatically handles renewals and what not after you setup a Cluster Issuer

## Installation using Helm

```bash
# Create Namespace
kubectl create namespace cert-manager

# Disable Resource Validation
kubectl label namespace cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true

# Install Cert Manager
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.15.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml

# Add Helm Chart and update Repo
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update

# Install Cert-Manager Chart
# !! Make sure you are in cert-manager namespace
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --version v0.15.1 --namespace cert-manager
```

## Installation using Kubectl

Simply run the following

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

❗ To Delete This you must first delete the resources without the CRDs first otherwise, It will make an absolute mess as the remaining resources will refuse to delete because the CRDS that describe them no longer exist

## Setup LetsEncrypt Cluster Issuer

First, you create a file called `cluster-issuers.yaml` and then paste in the following code.

**NOTE**❗❗ Make sure you replace the email placeholders **user@example.com** with your own email address. It won't work otherwise

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: user@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    solvers:
    # An empty 'selector' means that this solver matches all domains
    - selector: {}
      http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: user@example.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    # An empty 'selector' means that this solver matches all domains
    - selector: {}
      http01:
        ingress:
          class: nginx
```

then simply run

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster-issuers.yaml
```

You can confirm that it ran successfully but running

```bash
kubectl get clusterissuers
```
and you should get the following output
```
NAME                  READY   AGE
letsencrypt-prod      True    58s
letsencrypt-staging   True    58s
```

## Deploying SSL Certificates for Ingress

To setup an SSL Certificate simply use the annotation and the tls configuration below

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: usermanager
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod    # Specifies the Cluster Issuer to use
    acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"  # Tells Cert-Manager to override this ingress temporarily
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      - domain.example.com
      secretName: tls-domain-example  # Secret name is used to dynamically generate the secret
  rules:
  - host: domain.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: web
          servicePort: 80
```
